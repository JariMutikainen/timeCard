    WorkingDay inherits the __repr__()-method from the Day.
    It inherits the __init__()-method from the Day, but extends
    that method by fetching the contents for the instance attributes
    from the disk.

    A WorkingDay consists of logins and logouts. Each time the user logs
    in or out the time stamp of the event is recored and stored in the
    list of events. All the instance data is maintained in an external file
    on the disk. Each time a new event takes place the data is loaded from
    the disk, the new event is recorded an the data is dumped back into the
    disk. In addition to the login and logout methods this class offers
    methods for manually adding or subtracting time from the balance.
